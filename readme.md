## Goal
The goal section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project or software described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:

### **➡️ Problem Statement**

The problem statement for this project was that there was no clean website to exclusively share your Halloween costume with your friends and family. You would have to send them individually to each person, which would be time consuming and tedious. Or share on a generic social media platform, where it would get lost in the feed.

### **➡️ Objective(s)**

The objective of this project was to create a website where users could share their Halloween costumes with their friends and family. The website would be easy to use and have a clean Halloween user interface. The website would also be responsive and accessible for different screen sizes.

### **➡️ Target Audience**

The target audience were 16-25 year olds who were looking for a fun and easy way to share their Halloween costumes with their friends and family.

- They enjoy Halloween Parties, Horror Franchises and Socialising with their friends. 
- Their pain points would potentially be outdated user interfaces, slow loading times or the app being too similar to other social media platforms.

**User Stories:**

The user stories took into account the target audience and their pain points. The user stories were created using the Miro board.

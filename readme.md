# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro

Trick or Trend is a Halloween Costume sharing WebApp. The website allows users to share their Halloween costumes with their friends and family. The website is responsive and accessible for different screen sizes. The website has a clean and simple design, which is easy to navigate. The website has a dark theme with orange and purple accents.

## Goal
The goal section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project or software described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:

### ➡️ Problem Statement

The problem statement for this project was that there was no clean website to exclusively share your Halloween costume with your friends and family. You would have to send them individually to each person, which would be time consuming and tedious. Or share on a generic social media platform, where it would get lost in the feed.

### ➡️ Objective(s)

The objective of this project was to create a website where users could share their Halloween costumes with their friends and family. The website would be easy to use and have a clean Halloween user interface. The website would also be responsive and accessible for different screen sizes.

### ➡️ Target Audience

<img src="assets/media/targetaudience.png" width=500>

The target audience were 16-25 year olds who were looking for a fun and easy way to share their Halloween costumes with their friends and family.

- They enjoy Halloween Parties, Horror Franchises and Socialising with their friends. 
- Their pain points would potentially be outdated user interfaces, slow loading times or the app being too similar to other social media platforms.
- Two profiles were designed to evolve into the user stories and to design the website.
